# CyNetDiff Library

This is a library meant to be a performance-focused version of
ndlib. The focus here is on low memory usage and efficient evaluation
of the Monte-Carlo diffusion.

## Development

Package development is being done with Poetry. After cloning the repo,
run the following command to build the project:
```
poetry install
```

Then to run tests on the newly compiled code, run:
```
poetry run pytest
```
